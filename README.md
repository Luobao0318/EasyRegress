## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Login
*   **Username**: `admin`
*   **Password**: `password`

### 2. Workflow
1.  **Import Data**: Click "Import CSV / Excel" on the sidebar.
    *   *Sample Data*: You can use `factory_long_term_data.csv` provided in the repo for testing.
2.  **Clean Data**: Select a strategy (e.g., "Linear Interpolate" is best for time-series).
3.  **Variable Selection**:
    *   **Target (Y)**: The column you want to predict.
    *   **Features (X)**: The factors influencing the target. (If left empty, it predicts based on time index).
4.  **Train Model**:
    *   Select "AutoML" or a specific algorithm.

## ❓ FAQ & Troubleshooting

**Q: The charts are blank/white?**
A: This is usually due to missing `QtWebEngine` binaries.
*   If you are running from source, ensure `PyQtWebEngine` is installed.
*   If you are building it yourself, use `pyinstaller --collect-all PyQt5 ...`.
*   **Solution:** Download the official version from the **Releases** page, which fixes this issue.

**Q: PDF Export fails?**
A: The program generates temporary images for the PDF. Ensure the program has **write permissions** in its current folder (try running as Administrator or moving the folder out of C:\Program Files).

**Q: Text encoding issues (Garbled characters)?**
A: For best compatibility with the PDF generator, please ensure your CSV column headers use **English** or **Pinyin**.
